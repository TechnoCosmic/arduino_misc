Just some simple helper code for Arduino projects. To use most of them, just be sure to add the .cpp file(s) that you need into your Arduino project and away you go. No header file #includes are required, unless specified in this readme.

Sample code on how to use the new features is found in the ```arduino_misc.ino``` file.
